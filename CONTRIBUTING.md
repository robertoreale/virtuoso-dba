**IMPORTANT**

Please, don't forget to update your fork. While you made your changes, the content of the `master` branch can change because other pull requests were merged and it can create conflicts. This is why you have to rebase on `master` every time before pushing your changes and check that your branch doesn't have any conflicts with `master`.

Thank you.
