# The Virtuoso DBA

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robertoreale/virtuosodba.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robertoreale/virtuosodba)

Working as a DBA requires improving skills in at least two key areas: SQL and database administration.  Usually the paths to do so are separate: in this book we will try to unify them in a coherent manner.

You can read either read the book [online](https://robertoreale.me/virtuosodba/book) or get a [printable version](https://leanpub.com/virtuosodba).
