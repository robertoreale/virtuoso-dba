## First steps

### Show database role (primary, standby, etc.)

*Keywords*: dynamic views, data guard

    SELECT database_role FROM gv$database;


### List user Data Pump jobs

*Keywords*: LIKE, data pump

    SELECT
        owner_name,
        job_name,
        operation,
        job_mode,
        state,
        attached_sessions
    FROM
        dba_datapump_jobs
    WHERE
        job_name NOT LIKE 'BIN$%';


### List the top-n largest segments

*Keywords*: limiting query result, physical storage

    SELECT * FROM
    (
        SELECT
            owner,
            segment_name         AS segment,
            segment_type         AS type,
            tablespace_name      AS tablespace,
            bytes / 1024 / 1024  AS mib_total
        FROM dba_segments ORDER BY bytes DESC
    ) WHERE ROWNUM <= &n;


### Associate blocking and blocked sessions

*Keywords*: self join, locking

    SELECT
        l1.sid AS blocking,
        l2.sid AS blocked
    FROM
        gv$lock l1 JOIN gv$lock l2 USING (id1, id2)
    WHERE
        l1.block = 1 AND l2.request > 0;


### Calculate the size of the temporary tablespaces

*Keywords*: aggregate functions, dynamic views, logical storage

    SELECT
        inst_id,
        ts.name,
        tmpf.block_size,
        SUM(tmpf.bytes) AS bytes
    FROM
        gv$tablespace ts
    JOIN
        gv$tempfile tmpf
    USING
        (inst_id, ts##)
    GROUP BY
        inst_id, ts.name, tmpf.block_size;


### Calculate a fragmentation factor for tablespaces

*Keywords*: aggregate functions, logical storage

The fragmentation column gives an overall score with respect to how badly a
tablespace is fragmented; a 100% score indicates no fragmentation at all.

It is calculated according to the following formula:

                ___________      
              \/max(blocks)      
                         
    1 - ------------------------ 
                         
                    =====        
         4_______   \            
        \/blocks##    >    blocks 
                    /            
                    =====

        NVL(MAX(bytes) / 1048576, 0)  AS largest_chunk,
        100 * (
            1 - NVL(SQRT(MAX(blocks) / (SQRT(SQRT(COUNT(blocks))) * SUM(blocks))), 0)
        )                             AS fragmentation
