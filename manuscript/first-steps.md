## Calculate a fragmentation factor for tablespaces

*Keywords*: aggregate functions, logical storage

The fragmentation column gives an overall score with respect to how badly a
tablespace is fragmented; a 100% score indicates no fragmentation at all.

It is calculated according to the following formula:

                ___________      
              \/max(blocks)
